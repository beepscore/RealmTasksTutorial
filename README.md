# Results
## Do prerequisites as described in tutorial and appendix.

## Run RealmTasksTutorial on iPhone
log in using same credentials as in prerequisites.

## Realm Studio app
### open a local realm
Can view (and edit?) database records.
By default, realm writes file to Documents/default.realm
On iOS simulator, path is similar to
/Users/stevebaker/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/45FBEDC8-1E44-4717-8E97-B33310AA2F51/data/Containers/Data/Application/1AEF8D68-6E59-4FC2-B7C7-5AD11624D204/Documents/default.realm
You can manually copy this file and open it using Realm Studio / Open a local realm.
Presumably because you have a copy of the file, Realm Studio lets you view its records.
### connect to realm object server
Start realm object server. Start Realm Studio app and log in to server.
You can see list of realms and users. I didn't see a way for an admin to view a user's data directly.
This is good for privacy / security.
To see data, log in to server using username and password.

## Appendix Prerequisites
Use repo realm-tasks to create a realm database.

### realm-tasks
    git checkout master

### start realm object server
    cd realm_practice
    npm start

### realm studio
start realm studio

### realm-tasks
Start "RealmTasks Apple/RealmTasks.xcworkspace"
In Xcode, build and run scheme RealmTasks macOS.
Create user e.g. username test pw test
Now realm studio shows realm <uuid>/realmtasks
fields
id: string, text: string, date: date?, completed: bool
Manually add some tasks.
